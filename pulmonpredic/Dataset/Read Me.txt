Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs, often associated with smoking 
but also linked to factors like air pollution, genetic predisposition, and exposure to toxins such as asbestos and radon. 
It is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally, as it is often diagnosed in advanced stages.

There are two main types: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), the most common form, 
and Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC), which is more aggressive but less common. 

Symptoms include persistent cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and unexplained weight loss.

Early detection through screenings such as low-dose CT scans significantly improves outcomes. 
Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies, tailored to the cancer's type and stage. 

Preventive measures like avoiding smoking and reducing exposure to environmental risk factors are key to reducing lung cancer incidence.
